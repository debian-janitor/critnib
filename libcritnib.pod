=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<#include E<lt>critnib.hE<gt>>

Link with I<-lcritnib>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Functions:

=over

=item B<critnib *critnib_new(void);>

Creates a new empty critnib structure.

=item B<void critnib_delete(critnib *>I<c>B<);>

Destroys and frees the memory.  Note that removed items are reused but won't
have their memory freed until this function is called.

=item B<int critnib_insert(critnib *>I<c>B<, uint64_t >I<key>B<, void *>I<value>B<);>

Adds a key:value pair to the critnib structure.  It's an error (B<EEXISTS>)
if that key already exists.  May return B<ENOMEM> if we're out of memory,
or 0 if all went okay.

=item B<void *critnib_remove(critnib *>I<c>B<, uint64_t >I<key>B<);>

Removes a given key and its associated value from the structure.

=item B<void *critnib_get(critnib *>I<c>B<, uint64_t >I<key>B<);>

Obtains a value for a given key, or 0 (NULL) if not present.

=item B<void *critnib_find_le(critnib *>I<c>B<, uint64_t >I<key>B<);>

Searches for the largest key not exceeding the argument, and returns its value.
